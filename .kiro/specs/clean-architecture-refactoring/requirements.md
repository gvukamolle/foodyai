# Clean Architecture Refactoring - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the refactoring of the CalorieTracker Android application to implement Clean Architecture principles. The current architecture has all business logic mixed in ViewModels with direct dependencies on data and network layers, making it difficult to test, maintain, and scale. This refactoring will separate concerns into distinct layers with clear boundaries and dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Domain Layer Creation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean domain layer that contains pure business logic, so that the core functionality is independent of external frameworks and can be easily tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the domain layer THEN the system SHALL create a `domain/` directory structure with subdirectories:
   - `domain/entities/` - for business models
   - `domain/usecases/` - for business operations
   - `domain/repositories/` - for repository interfaces
2. WHEN moving business models THEN the system SHALL migrate entities like `FoodItem`, `UserProfile`, `Meal`, `ChatMessage` to `domain/entities/`
3. WHEN creating repository interfaces THEN the system SHALL define contracts in `domain/repositories/` without implementation details
4. WHEN implementing domain layer THEN the system SHALL ensure no dependencies on Android framework or external libraries

### Requirement 2: Use Cases Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-defined use cases that encapsulate business operations, so that business logic is reusable and testable in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating use cases THEN the system SHALL implement the following core use cases:
   - `AnalyzeFoodPhotoUseCase` - for AI photo analysis
   - `SaveFoodIntakeUseCase` - for saving food consumption
   - `CalculateNutritionUseCase` - for nutrition calculations
   - `GetUserProfileUseCase` - for user profile management
   - `GetDailyIntakeUseCase` - for retrieving daily nutrition data
2. WHEN implementing use cases THEN each use case SHALL follow single responsibility principle
3. WHEN creating use cases THEN they SHALL only depend on domain entities and repository interfaces
4. WHEN executing use cases THEN they SHALL return domain entities or simple data types

### Requirement 3: Data Layer Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean data layer that implements domain repository interfaces, so that data access is abstracted and can be easily swapped or mocked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring data layer THEN the system SHALL implement repository interfaces from domain layer
2. WHEN creating repositories THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into:
   - `FoodRepository` - for food-related data operations
   - `UserRepository` - for user profile and authentication
   - `NutritionRepository` - for nutrition tracking and history
3. WHEN implementing repositories THEN they SHALL handle data mapping between network/database models and domain entities
4. WHEN accessing external APIs THEN repositories SHALL handle all network and caching logic
5. WHEN storing data locally THEN repositories SHALL manage SharedPreferences and database operations

### Requirement 4: Presentation Layer Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ViewModels that only handle UI state and delegate business operations to use cases, so that presentation logic is separated from business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring ViewModels THEN they SHALL only depend on use cases from domain layer
2. WHEN removing direct dependencies THEN ViewModels SHALL NOT directly call repositories or network services
3. WHEN handling UI operations THEN ViewModels SHALL delegate business logic to appropriate use cases
4. WHEN managing state THEN ViewModels SHALL focus only on UI state management and user interactions
5. WHEN updating ViewModels THEN all business logic SHALL be moved to appropriate use cases

### Requirement 5: Dependency Injection Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want properly configured dependency injection that respects Clean Architecture boundaries, so that dependencies flow in the correct direction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring DI THEN domain layer SHALL NOT depend on data or presentation layers
2. WHEN setting up modules THEN data layer SHALL implement domain interfaces
3. WHEN injecting dependencies THEN presentation layer SHALL only receive domain use cases
4. WHEN creating Hilt modules THEN they SHALL be organized by architectural layer
5. WHEN binding interfaces THEN repository implementations SHALL be properly bound to domain interfaces

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Data Flow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling and data flow patterns across all layers, so that the application behaves predictably and errors are properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing use cases THEN they SHALL return `Result<T>` or similar wrapper for error handling
2. WHEN handling errors THEN each layer SHALL transform errors appropriately for its consumers
3. WHEN flowing data THEN the system SHALL use consistent patterns (Flow, LiveData, etc.)
4. WHEN processing async operations THEN proper coroutine scoping SHALL be maintained
5. WHEN mapping data THEN transformations between layers SHALL be explicit and testable

### Requirement 7: Testing Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a testable architecture where each layer can be tested in isolation, so that I can ensure code quality and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating domain layer THEN use cases SHALL be easily unit testable without Android dependencies
2. WHEN implementing repositories THEN they SHALL be mockable for testing presentation layer
3. WHEN testing ViewModels THEN they SHALL only need to mock use cases, not repositories or network services
4. WHEN writing tests THEN each layer SHALL have clear testing boundaries
5. WHEN mocking dependencies THEN interfaces SHALL enable easy mocking and stubbing

### Requirement 8: Migration Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a safe migration path that doesn't break existing functionality, so that the refactoring can be done incrementally without disrupting the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting migration THEN existing functionality SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN moving code THEN changes SHALL be made incrementally, one layer at a time
3. WHEN updating imports THEN all references SHALL be properly updated
4. WHEN testing migration THEN existing tests SHALL continue to pass or be updated accordingly
5. WHEN completing migration THEN no old architecture patterns SHALL remain in the codebase
