## Architecture Validation

### Clean Architecture Principles âœ…

#### 1. Dependency Rule
- âœ… Dependencies point inward toward domain layer
- âœ… Domain layer has no external dependencies
- âœ… Data layer implements domain interfaces
- âœ… Presentation layer only depends on domain

#### 2. Separation of Concerns
- âœ… Domain layer contains business logic only
- âœ… Data layer handles data access and storage
- âœ… Presentation layer manages UI state and user interactions
- âœ… Each layer has clear responsibilities

#### 3. Independence
- âœ… Domain layer is framework-independent
- âœ… Business logic can be tested without Android dependencies
- âœ… Data sources can be easily swapped
- âœ… UI framework changes don't affect business logic

#### 4. Testability
- âœ… All layers can be tested in isolation
- âœ… Dependencies can be easily mocked
- âœ… Business logic has comprehensive unit tests
- âœ… Integration tests validate layer interactions
