# ADR-001: Adoption of Clean Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Calorie Tracker application was initially built using a traditional MVVM architecture with ViewModels directly accessing repositories and data sources. As the application grew in complexity, several issues emerged:

1. **Tight Coupling**: ViewModels were tightly coupled to data layer implementations
2. **Difficult Testing**: Business logic was scattered across ViewModels and repositories
3. **Mixed Responsibilities**: Data transformation and business logic were mixed
4. **Scalability Issues**: Adding new features required changes across multiple layers
5. **Code Duplication**: Similar business operations were repeated in different ViewModels

## Decision
We decided to refactor the application to follow Clean Architecture principles with the following structure:

### Domain Layer (Core Business Logic)
- **Entities**: Core business objects (User, Food, NutritionIntake, etc.)
- **Use Cases**: Specific business operations (SaveFoodIntakeUseCase, CalculateNutritionTargetsUseCase)
- **Repository Interfaces**: Abstractions for data access
- **Common Types**: Result wrapper, domain exceptions

### Data Layer (External Concerns)
- **Repository Implementations**: Concrete implementations of domain interfaces
- **Mappers**: Transform between data and domain models
- **Data Sources**: Room database, SharedPreferences, Network APIs

### Presentation Layer (UI)
- **ViewModels**: Manage UI state and coordinate with Use Cases
- **UI Components**: Jetpack Compose screens and components

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Better Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Independence**: Domain layer is independent of frameworks
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify code
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations (e.g., change data sources)

### Negative
- **Initial Complexity**: More files and abstractions to understand
- **Development Overhead**: More boilerplate code initially
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand Clean Architecture principles

### Neutral
- **Code Volume**: More files but better organized
- **Performance**: Minimal impact due to additional abstraction layers

## Implementation Details

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Create domain layer structure (entities, use cases, repository interfaces)
2. **Phase 2**: Implement use cases for core business operations
3. **Phase 3**: Create data layer with repository implementations and mappers
4. **Phase 4**: Update presentation layer to use use cases instead of repositories
5. **Phase 5**: Update dependency injection configuration
6. **Phase 6**: Add comprehensive testing for all layers
7. **Phase 7**: Clean up old architecture remnants and update documentation

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Result Wrapper**: Use `Result<T>` for consistent error handling across layers
- **Use Case Pattern**: Each business operation has its own use case class
- **Mapper Pattern**: Separate mappers for data transformation between layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Use Hilt for managing dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Domain-specific exceptions for business logic errors

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Keep Existing MVVM
- **Pros**: No refactoring needed, familiar to team
- **Cons**: Existing problems would persist and worsen over time

### 2. MVI (Model-View-Intent)
- **Pros**: Unidirectional data flow, predictable state management
- **Cons**: Significant learning curve, overkill for current requirements

### 3. Modular Architecture
- **Pros**: Better separation by features
- **Cons**: More complex build setup, premature for current app size

## Validation
The success of this decision will be measured by:
- **Test Coverage**: Achieve >80% test coverage across all layers
- **Code Quality**: Reduced cyclomatic complexity and improved maintainability metrics
- **Development Velocity**: Faster feature development after initial migration
- **Bug Reduction**: Fewer bugs due to better separation of concerns
- **Team Satisfaction**: Developer feedback on code maintainability
